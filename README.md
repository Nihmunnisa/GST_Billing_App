# GST_Billing_App
This is a basic GST billing app for a grocery store.
To get started with the web application using Angular 4 , you need to install the Angular CLI with the command:

npm install -g @angular/cli

To serve the application, navigate to the project directory and try the command :
ng serve
If the above command shows error that 'the port is already in use', try to specify another port using the command given below:
ng serve --port <port_number>

To navigate to the website, point your browser to http://localhost:4200 and you should be able to view the GST billing app running!!
